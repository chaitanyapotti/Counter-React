1. On initial load, it flickers and shows install/unlock screen before switching to correct network
2. Straight up crashes if network !== (rinkeby || kovan)
3. Maintain a log of transaction hashes and show them in a table beside landing form

sending tx:
const txHash = await counterRinkeby.methods.refund().send({from: account[0]}).transactionHash;
const tx = {txHash, network};

transaction log table

txHash1 (hyperlink to "https://"+network+".etherscan.io/tx/"+tx.txHash)
txHash2
txHash3
txHash4

Maintain the table in Landing page and keep adding items to it from remaining 3 forms + refund btn.

4. Add that txHash1 link to bottom notifier as "Check tx status here: (hyperlink)"

5. Spinner beside all tx buttons. (spinner start when tx btn is clicked, ends when it gets disabled/tx is complete. when complete, spinner turns into a (green)tick or some
symbol like that)

6. npm run deploy and check if it is loading in gh-pages


issues with gh-pages:
GitHub Pages doesn’t support routers that use the HTML5 pushState history API under the hood (for example, React Router using browserHistory). 
This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42, where /todos/42 is a frontend route, 
the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of /todos/42. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:

You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to hashHistory for this effect, 
but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj). Read more about different history 
implementations in React Router.
Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to your index.html page with a special redirect parameter.
You would need to add a 404.html file with the redirection code to the build folder before deploying your project, 
and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to index.html. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique in this guide.
