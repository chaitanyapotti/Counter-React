1. On initial load, it flickers and shows install/unlock screen before switching to correct network
2. Straight up crashes if network !== (rinkeby || kovan)
3. Maintain a log of transaction hashes and show them in a table beside landing form

sending tx:
const txHash = await counterRinkeby.methods.refund().send({from: account[0]}).transactionHash;
const tx = {txHash, network};

transaction log table

txHash1 (hyperlink to "https://"+network+".etherscan.io/tx/"+tx.txHash)
txHash2
txHash3
txHash4

Maintain the table in Landing page and keep adding items to it from remaining 3 forms + refund btn.

4. Spinner beside all tx buttons. (spinner start when tx btn is clicked, ends when it gets disabled/tx is complete. when complete, spinner turns into a (green)tick or some
symbol like that)

5. npm run deploy and check if it is loading in gh-pages
